The company helps retailers enhance their customer experience by giving customers the choice to receive their items whenever and wherever they want. Deliv allows retailers to offer their customers a same-day delivery option as they shop from their website, mobile app or even when they are shopping in their physical brick and mortar stores.  The same-day delivery button is simply added into the existing checkout process which allows the retailer to maintain ownership and data from each customer transaction. All same-day delivery orders (whether purchased online or in the store) are fulfilled and delivered from local brick and mortar stores, which now allow retailers’ stores to strategically become local distribution centers. This allows retailers to deliver faster and cheaper and in a more convenient way than any pure play eCommerce player like Amazon.

Branded entertainment in movies & TV shows is currently a $23B globally ($10B USA) industry available only to major brands and growing at 17% CAGR.  Simultaneously, interstitial TV advertising is in decline whilst proliferating content (487 new scripted shows in 2017). This means a declining return on assets. At the same time, ad-skipping and ad-blocking are devastating traditional revenue models. Remarkably, branded entertainment today is a manual process whereby products are delivered by hand to set. Additionally, simple adjustments in camera movement such as a pan left or right can obfuscate a brand requiring reshoots. Brands are also fixed in perpetuity and not able to be edited or updated. By introducing digital technology, we can bring branded entertainment into the modern world and disrupt incumbents creating a multibillion-dollar cutting edge business.

Its storage is designed for business agility. ClearSky simplifies enterprise storage by providing an SLA-based managed service across the global network. The company's patent-pending Smart Tiered Caching continually categorizes data and places it in the right cache layer (hot, warm, cold) based on evolving usage requirements and customer policies. Customers simply scale as needed, using the ClearSky dashboard to add unlimited capacity with a few clicks.   All data can be moved across the ClearSky network to meet a variety of use cases including data center migration, load balancing, expansion into new regions, or disaster recovery. ClearSky has partnered with major public clouds to place hot and warm cache copies at the cloud edge. The result: customers get low-latency access to cloud instances, providing a new cost-effective option to run their most demanding workloads. The total cost of ownership (TCO) of storing data using the ClearSky service is about 1/3 the cost of managing it in a company’s data center on physical storage arrays.

Wonga offers cash deposits within minutes and loans are available up to £750, for between five and 30 days. Wonga's real-time and fully automated loan processing systems means more speed, convenience, and flexibility than a typical online lender, or indeed any traditional form of credit. The principle behind Wonga is that customers use the service on an occasional basis, in reaction to cash emergencies, rather than as an ongoing source of credit. In contrast to credit cards, traditional loans and bank overdrafts, the idea is that money is repaid quickly, thereby avoiding long-term debt.

At first, The DAO will focus on projects related to the sharing economy and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications of the blockchain – though the organization said it is interested in exploring other “new markets unlocked by blockchain technology.”The DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO”) - more specifically, it is a new breed of human organization never before attempted. The DAO is borne from immutable, unstoppable, and irrefutable computer code, operated entirely by its members, and fueled using ETH which Creates DAO tokens. Several aspects of this structure make it revolutionary: Inclusion: The DAO leverages smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone, anywhere in the world can be empowered to participate. In exchange for their early help, participants receive DAO tokens which hold many benefits. Flexibility: The DAO backs Proposals which it selects for their innovative nature, to be delivered by Contractors. Some of these Proposals could hold no promise of return whatsoever (in the case of a charity for example), others could involve the building of products or services which The DAO could then use for its own purposes. Profitability and Growth: The DAO charges for the use of its the products or services. This revenue is then sent directly to The DAO in the form of ETH. The DAO then has the option to accumulate this ETH to support its growth, or redistribute it to the DAO Token Holders as a reward. Autonomous Governance: The ETH held by The DAO will never be centrally managed. DAO Token Holders are able to vote on important decisions relating to the management of The DAO, including the power to redistribute its ETH amongst themselves. The DAO, represented by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain at address 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, intends to back a series of Proposals to create products or services. The DAO Token Holders will then leverage these products or services, or charge others for using them. In June 2016, users exploited a vulnerability in the DAO code to enable them to siphon off one-third of The DAO's funds to a subsidiary account. On 20 July 2016, the Ethereum community decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore virtually all funds to the original contract. This was controversial and led to a fork in Ethereum, where the original unforked blockchain was maintained as Ethereum Classic, thus breaking Ethereum into two separate active blockchains, each with its own cryptocurrency. The DAO was delisted from trading on major exchanges such as Poloniex and Kraken in late 2016.",,https://daohub.org,,"Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Information Technology, Internet Services, Payments, Professional Services, Software",,Initial Coin Offering,31,,,2016,Initial Coin Offering,1,,163000000,163000000,163000000,163000000,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,500000,,,,,,,,,,,,5258064.516,16129.03226,5258064.516,,,,,"Software, Internet, Information Technology",Technology & Software,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No

Moreover, those companies do not offer online payment. It exists the phone booking but calling centers do not answer or the line is busy. The last solution to buy a bus ticket is to go to the terminal but all the companies have their own bus terminal. There is no online platform that concentrates the bus company offers and information such as bus services, or different prices.  The Solution: We offer two solutions: a BtoC and a BtoBtoC system. The BtoC is the busportal.pe website where customers can compare all the companies integrated on the website and buy their bus tickets online. The BtoBtoC solution is a integrated selling platform on the bus websites to manage their billing process online. The Opportunity: We are working both in local and international market. The company local market is defined by the country. We are targeting the mid-Low and Mid-High segment both local and international travelers. We offer various different bus services to target a large audience. We are currently targeting internet users. Latin America has 1 billion bus travelers per year, with an internet growth rate around 12%. The mobile phone penetration is 112%. Competitive Advantage: First mover Advantage in the Peruvian market. We have two weapons: the mobile application will be automatically install on Movistar's mobile phone in every country we are going as we have the exclusivity with Movistar and Telefonica. Moreover we have signed some agreements with the Peruvian government to let them use our widget on the Peruvian official websites. the widget is a access to the Busportal database with the design of the website where the widget is implemented. The Revenue Model: We have various mechanisms to generate revenue. The main mechanism is the commission both BtoC and BtoBtoC paid by the bus companies on each bus ticket we sell. We do not charge the customer for our fee. We also generate selling reports for the bus companies to improve efficiency. We are developing additional mechanisms such the fee on a disbursement, ads on the website.
