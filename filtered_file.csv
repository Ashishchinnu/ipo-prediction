The DAO,"The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), works as a decentralized fund management investing in blockchain projects. At first, The DAO will focus on projects related to the sharing economy and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications of the blockchain – though the organization said it is interested in exploring other “new markets unlocked by blockchain technology.”The DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO”) - more specifically, it is a new breed of human organization never before attempted. The DAO is borne from immutable, unstoppable, and irrefutable computer code, operated entirely by its members, and fueled using ETH which Creates DAO tokens. Several aspects of this structure make it revolutionary: Inclusion: The DAO leverages smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain so that anyone, anywhere in the world can be empowered to participate. In exchange for their early help, participants receive DAO tokens which hold many benefits. Flexibility: The DAO backs Proposals which it selects for their innovative nature, to be delivered by Contractors. Some of these Proposals could hold no promise of return whatsoever (in the case of a charity for example), others could involve the building of products or services which The DAO could then use for its own purposes. Profitability and Growth: The DAO charges for the use of its the products or services. This revenue is then sent directly to The DAO in the form of ETH. The DAO then has the option to accumulate this ETH to support its growth, or redistribute it to the DAO Token Holders as a reward. Autonomous Governance: The ETH held by The DAO will never be centrally managed. DAO Token Holders are able to vote on important decisions relating to the management of The DAO, including the power to redistribute its ETH amongst themselves. The DAO, represented by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain at address 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413, intends to back a series of Proposals to create products or services. The DAO Token Holders will then leverage these products or services, or charge others for using them. In June 2016, users exploited a vulnerability in the DAO code to enable them to siphon off one-third of The DAO's funds to a subsidiary account. On 20 July 2016, the Ethereum community decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore virtually all funds to the original contract. This was controversial and led to a fork in Ethereum, where the original unforked blockchain was maintained as Ethereum Classic, thus breaking Ethereum into two separate active blockchains, each with its own cryptocurrency. The DAO was delisted from trading on major exchanges such as Poloniex and Kraken in late 2016."

There is no online platform that concentrates the bus company offers and information such as bus services, or different prices.  The Solution: We offer two solutions: a BtoC and a BtoBtoC system. The BtoC is the busportal.pe website where customers can compare all the companies integrated on the website and buy their bus tickets online. The BtoBtoC solution is a integrated selling platform on the bus websites to manage their billing process online. The Opportunity: We are working both in local and international market.

We offer various different bus services to target a large audience. We are currently targeting internet users.

Moreover we have signed some agreements with the Peruvian government to let them use our widget on the Peruvian official websites. the widget is a access to the Busportal database with the design of the website where the widget is implemented. The Revenue Model: We have various mechanisms to generate revenue. The main mechanism is the commission both BtoC and BtoBtoC paid by the bus companies on each bus ticket we sell. We do not charge the customer for our fee. We also generate selling reports for the bus companies to improve efficiency. We are developing additional mechanisms such the fee on a disbursement, ads on the website. As we have a positive and consequent treasury (we pay our suppliers 20 days after) we can generate financial revenues."

Chimerix,"Chimerix is developing novel antiviral therapeutics with the potential to transform patient care in multiple settings, including transplant, oncology, acute care and global health. The company's lead candidate, CMX001, is being developed as a potential broad spectrum antiviral agent for the treatment of life-threatening double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral diseases. Over 350 people have received CMX001 to date, with a growing body of evidence supporting the drug's antiviral activity in humans. Clinical studies of CMX001 include an ongoing Phase 2 study of the prevention/control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-201), a Phase 2 study being initiated for the treatment of adenovirus (AdV) infection in pediatric and adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients (CMX001-202), and an Open-Label Study (CMX001-350) for the treatment of any of 12 different dsDNA viral infections, including AdV, herpes viruses such as CMV, herpes simplex virus and Epstein Barr virus, polyoma viruses such as BK virus and JC virus, and pox viruses. The Open-Label Study builds on Chimerixâ€™s extensive experience working with clinicians at over 55 leading institutions in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel who have sought CMX001 for the treatment of more than 150 immunocompromised patients under Emergency INDs. CMX001 has been well tolerated in all studies. CMX001 is also being developed as a medical countermeasure in the event of a smallpox release. Chimerix has received significant federal funding for the development of CMX001 as a medical countermeasure against smallpox from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Chimerix's second clinical-stage antiviral compound, CMX157, a potent nucleoside analogue with in vitro activity against HIV and hepatitis B, has the potential to directly address several limitations of current HIV therapies. Chimerix is developing CMX157 for the treatment of HIV infection including those caused by multi-drug resistant viruses. A Phase 1 clinical study has been completed demonstrating that the compound is well tolerated and that the active antiviral, TFV-PP, was measurable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after a single dose and remained detectable for six days, indicating that it may be suitable for once-weekly dosing. Led by a world-class antiviral drug development team, Chimerix is also leveraging the company's extensive chemical library to pursue new treatments for hepatitis C virus, flu, malaria and other global public health needs."

ASAP has transformed the way restaurants reach people & the way people choose restaurants. The ASAP delivery team & on-demand delivery platform differentiates itself from the pack by being built by hospitality professionals for hospitality professionals. ASAP (formerly known as Waitr) began in late 2013 and started in Chris Meaux's home office and moved into the SEED Center, a Lake Charles, Louisiana business incubator near McNeese State University's campus on Ryan Street. In late 2015, by the end of the first year of operations, 57,000 food delivery orders had been placed on the Waitr app. That was when the decision was made by then CEO Chris Meaux to begin to amp up the digital marketing & operations efforts in addition to the engineering and administrative efforts to guide the company. In marketing, Patrick Hardey was added to the team to take over founder Addison Killebrew's marketing role alongside Katie Davis & Chloe Friend. For operations, Matt Sarradet, Charity Grandchampt, and Crystal Day were hired. As they grew quickly, several months into 2016 their first acquisition took place when they bought GoGoGrocer and then a competitor called Requested out of Northern California founded by San Francisco's Jeff Bolante, & Sacramento's Sonny Mayugba, two seasoned marketing veterans who dropped out of Facebook's Global Marketing Team responsible for developing and growing the Facebook Blueprint. With Sonny Mayugba and Jeff Bolante at the helm in combination with an already successful marketing effort they were able to mentor Patrick Hardey into becoming a customer acquisition professional on Facebook rapidly, which was alluded to by CEO Chris Meaux in a 2017 YouTube video. Some time later Patrick Hardey spearheaded an internal business unit embedded in the marketing department called Partner Marketing (premium digital marketing service), and also cofounded  the Waitr Impact corporate social responsibility program after a pitch to executives and board members, and afterward was invited to join the operations stewardship council. Subsequently, through their teamwork with operations, HR, sales, and service they posted a 20%+ month-to-month growth rate average for roughly 3 consecutive years before going public through a strategic partner in the world's wealthiest restauranteur who was impressed with their ability to bring in and keep customers happy on the B2B and B2C fronts. Through a SPAC led by Tilman Fertitta (who is the Billion Dollar Buyer (CNBC), owner of Landry's, the Houston Rockets (NBA), and the entire Golden Nugget casino resort franchise) they exited onto the Nasdaq in November 2018 at $308M, Louisiana history's largest tech exit valuation, and the world's second publicly traded food delivery company beating Uber to the public markets."

Orgenesis,"Orgenesis is a development stage company with a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of diabetes by correcting malfunctioning organs with new functional tissues created from the patient’s own existing organs. Orgenesis employs a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes. This new therapeutic approach is called Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) cell transplantation. Beta cell replacement is one of the most promising approaches for treatment of Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). Currently, pancreas islet transplantation is the only approved cell replacement technology and it's the best available treatment for diabetics. However, it's impractical because of a shortage of donor tissue and rejection rate by the patient' immune system. Orgenesis believes that converting the diabetic patients own tissue to insulin producing cells will overcome the problem of donor shortage. Moreover, since the diabetic patient serves as his/her own donor, there is no risk of transplant rejection. Orgenesis has manifested promising results in in-vitro and in-vivo studies using human liver tissues. Based on this significant discovery and these findings, Orgenesis has designed an efficient and clear work-plan to initiate clinical testing in the next few months allowing the company to launch phase I clinical trials following FDA guidelines followed by the launch of Phase II clinical trials within a year."

American Addiction Centers,"American Addiction Centers is one of the leading U.S. providers of substance abuse and mental health services that offers a network of rehab facilities across six states. The company was originally founded in 2007, and it has since experienced significant growth in recent years. This is partially due to its proven approaches to helping the victims of mental illnesses and patients struggling with addiction. In particular, AAC uses research-driven treatment methodologies that have proven to be highly effective for treating drug dependence, chronic alcoholism, and behavioral health concerns. In a drive to capitalize on its recent successes, AAC aims to continue expanding to open new treatment centers while further improving the quality of its services. Founded by an Experienced Team Michael Cartwright, a mental health practitioner with over 20 years of experience, founded AAC in 2007 with the mission of helping adult patients by providing high-quality and compassionate care. His participation in supervising 15 federally funded studies on mental illness had taught him that there were broad areas of the mental health field that were entirely unaddressed. Cartwright saw an especially significant need among patients with co-occurring mental disorders, and he aimed to position his company to address these issues through all available means. Cartwright experienced his own struggles that he had overcome by the beginning of his professional career. Drawing from this personal experience, he knew that co-occurring disorders were a severe issue that most treatment providers ignore. For instance, many patients who have depression often turn to alcoholism, and this, in turn, can later lead to a further spiral of descent. AAC was founded with the mission of helping patients with co-occurring disorders to return to normal life and to get out of what can seem like an impossible trap. Over time, AAC learned highly effective approaches to helping patients with co-occurring disorders and related difficulties, and it consequently expanded rapidly in the years following its initial founding. Facilities Across the U.S. AAC was founded with the understanding that it would be a national company that would focus on the geographical markets that are in the greatest need of its services. As a result, the company decided to open its headquarters in Tennessee, a state where it does not have any treatment centers but where its executive team can remain close to its other treatment centers across the country. Overall, AAC has treatment centers in New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Texas, Nevada, Florida, and California. In future years, AAC will continue to move into new markets as additional opportunities are uncovered in the marketplace and as more funding becomes available. A Publicly Traded Company In the mental health field, most providers are small local companies that lack the resources of a national network. American Addiction Centers, on the other hand, takes a more growth-oriented approach that focuses on leveraging the expertise available across all of its locations. In today's data-driven economy, AAC has significant scale advantages that its competitors do not have, and it is better able to address a national audience that often finds providers through the internet. Consequently, AAC made the decision to become the first provider in the addiction treatment industry to become publicly traded. With a more visible profile and better access to capital, the company has been able to grow in ways that its competitors have been unable to match. New Treatment Centers Shortly after going public, AAC made the decision to begin acquiring companies that match its general strategy. In December 2014, the company took over Recovery First, a substance abuse company based in Florida, for $13 million. The treatment center in Fort Lauderdale owned by Recovery First was already generating $7 million per year in revenue, and it was near two other facilities that AAC owned in Florida at the time. AAC also made investments in other treatment centers across the U.S. in subsequent years. A Focus on Raising Awareness Additionally, the company acquired two digital marketing companies, Taj Media and Referral Solutions Group, in 2015. Digital marketing expertise helped AAC to increase its visibility among patients looking for solutions online. A focus on digital marketing also led AAC to begin leveraging Michael Cartwright's expertise in conducting research studies that could be published online to increase visibility. Many of the studies that the company has since published have led to advancements that have significantly helped mental health patients while aiding them toward discovering new treatment options. AAC's Unique Approach AAC applies an interventional approach that focuses on using all interpersonal resources in a patient's life, such as family, coworkers, and friends, to encourage successful treatment. Most people are ultimately driven by the social pressures in their lives, so interventional medicine can help patients on a day-to-day basis to get the help they would not be able to get on their own. AAC's interventional approaches can also help family members who have been struggling to get a loved one to seek the assistance they need. The company can send a treatment specialist out to a patient's home in an attempt to encourage the individual to seek help, and it can also contact the patient over the phone. By working holistically to address the human side of addiction treatment, AAC has been able to realize more success than conventional providers. Veterans Addiction Study In 2019, American Addiction Centers received significant media coverage for creating ""Veteran Mental Health and Substance Abuse in America,"" a study on the mental health of U.S. veterans. The study found that binge drinking among veterans had increased significantly in the period between 2013 and 2017. Moreover, the study also found that drunk driving was also on the rise among veterans. With millions of veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and other severe issues, the groundbreaking study was important for helping to bring attention to struggling veterans who are often ignored. Services Tailored to Veterans After releasing its study, AAC increased its focus on helping veterans to get the mental health treatment that they need. For veterans, AAC uses a compassionate approach that is focused on getting patients lasting results. Veterans with PTSD are particularly difficult to help because many of them have been struggling for over 20 years, and they have often failed repeatedly to find a solution. AAC has medical staff dedicated specifically to veterans, and these staff members are encouraged to conduct their own research while on the job. Consequently, the company has been able to discover innovative approaches to helping veterans that are not practiced by other providers in the industry. Far From Finished Documentary In a further attempt to raise awareness, American Addiction Centers launched ""Far From Finished,"" a new series of documentaries that offer an in-depth view of how struggling patients are able to recover from severe mental health issues. For instance, one episode of the series follows a 14-year-old drug user named Dominic Grefsrud. Although Grefsrud was very young at the time when the documentary was filmed, he had already used methamphetamine, alcohol, and other illicit drugs. Unfortunately, his addiction eventually led to him turning to dealing drugs in an attempt to get the funds to buy the substances that he needed. With the help of AAC, Grefsrud was able to return to normal life before the substances were able to destroy his future. The series by AAC was released for free on its Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts."

Otta,"Our mission is to become the world's career champion. This means putting candidates first — not companies. Today we're focused on building the better way to find a fulfilling job in tech. In the future, we'll help people find jobs at all of the best companies. Looking for a job is a frustrating experience. It's incredibly hard to find a good match. Job adverts lack useful information like salary and diversity data. Companies sometimes never respond. There’s a lack of friendly-support in those tough moments of rejection … the list goes on. When starting Otta, we saw that candidates are often treated as second-class citizens. So we set out to build a candidate-first job search: one that is laser-focused on providing the best experience for candidates. There’s a big market to go after in recruitment, with LinkedIn selling over $10bn/year of recruitment products. But it’s impossible to battle a giant like LinkedIn if you try and compete on all jobs from Day 1. So we chose tech companies as our first move. As we grow, we’ll expand into other industries to help more people find fulfillment. Since launching in Jan 2020, we’ve grown from 1,000 applications sent per month to multiple thousands sent every day, across the UK & US. Otta is becoming a must-have for companies, and this puts us in a strong position to demand a better experience for candidates. For example, what if we said to companies that jobs without a salary range will be shown last?"

Loxo Oncology,"Loxo Oncology was incorporated in Delaware in May 2013 and was founded by Josh Bilenker, M.D., a partner at Aisling Capital. Loxo Oncology is committed to bringing targeted cancer therapies rapidly into the clinic that have an opportunity for outsized clinical effects in genetically defined patient populations. Loxo Oncology derives its company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery. It is an exciting time to develop cancer drugs. Diagnostic methods are yielding strong clues about which cancer features are actionable, “driver mutations,” in contrast to those merely along for the ride as “passenger mutations.” In the last five years, these insights have transformed the standard of care in melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers. Picking a target is just the first step in building a cancer drug. Good chemists build good drugs. The physical properties of a compound have much to do with its ultimate success or failure. Is it stable? Is it soluble? Is it absorbed? Does it reach its target? Does it engage the target? Does it cause toxicity elsewhere in the body before it achieves maximum efficacy in the cancer? In our opinion, drugs that achieve excellent exposure in the body and are highly specific for their intended targets have the highest chances of success. Once an attractive target is selected and a drug with best-in-class properties is constructed, setting up the right clinical development plan is of utmost importance. Our goal is to generate a clinical path that reflects the underlying scientific hypothesis that made the drug interesting in the first place. This often means developing the drug in a population of patients whose tumors possess a specific genetic vulnerability targeted by the drug. Loxo Oncology was built around a team of full-time professionals and engaged scientific advisors who are aligned in choosing the most actionable targets, and pursuing them through disciplined clinical trial approaches. Our license and collaboration agreement with Array Biopharma and our experienced team allows us to construct drugs with best-in-class properties from the ground up."

C4 Therapeutics,"C4 is building on the knowledge with synthetic chemical compounds which it calls Degronimids. These compounds can be engineered and linked together to bind with many molecular targets that today’s drugs can’t bind with, Cohen said. The key insight, he said, is that the scientific founders have discovered a way to bind with select disease-causing proteins, and flag them as cellular trash, so that the ordinary proteasome garbage disposal system can get rid of them. Selecting the precise disease-related proteins to send to the trash is obviously critical, because any drug like this could cause serious side effects if it sent healthy proteins involved in normal cell processes to the trash. C4 Therapeutics is developing a new class of targeted protein degradation (TPD) therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases. Our Degronimid™ platform incorporates highly selective small molecule binders to target disease-causing proteins and facilitate their rapid destruction and clearance from the cell through the natural ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). Because of this distinctive mechanism, Degronimids are capable of hitting many more targets, including those previously thought to be undruggable, while reducing the potential for drug resistance. The broad applicability of Degronimids, and our chemical biology platform designed for accelerated validation, have the potential to make an unprecedented impact across many diseases through multiple industry collaborations as well as proprietary programs. The Company has received an exclusive worldwide license to the Degronimid platform and related IP from Dana-Farber."

Loxo Oncology,"Loxo Oncology was incorporated in Delaware in May 2013 and was founded by Josh Bilenker, M.D., a partner at Aisling Capital. Loxo Oncology is committed to bringing targeted cancer therapies rapidly into the clinic that have an opportunity for outsized clinical effects in genetically defined patient populations. Loxo Oncology derives its company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery. It is an exciting time to develop cancer drugs. Diagnostic methods are yielding strong clues about which cancer features are actionable, “driver mutations,” in contrast to those merely along for the ride as “passenger mutations.” In the last five years, these insights have transformed the standard of care in melanoma, lung cancer and other cancers. Picking a target is just the first step in building a cancer drug. Good chemists build good drugs. The physical properties of a compound have much to do with its ultimate success or failure. Is it stable? Is it soluble? Is it absorbed? Does it reach its target? Does it engage the target? Does it cause toxicity elsewhere in the body before it achieves maximum efficacy in the cancer? In our opinion, drugs that achieve excellent exposure in the body and are highly specific for their intended targets have the highest chances of success. Once an attractive target is selected and a drug with best-in-class properties is constructed, setting up the right clinical development plan is of utmost importance. Our goal is to generate a clinical path that reflects the underlying scientific hypothesis that made the drug interesting in the first place. This often means developing the drug in a population of patients whose tumors possess a specific genetic vulnerability targeted by the drug. Loxo Oncology was built around a team of full-time professionals and engaged scientific advisors who are aligned in choosing the most actionable targets, and pursuing them through disciplined clinical trial approaches. Our license and collaboration agreement with Array Biopharma and our experienced team allows us to construct drugs with best-in-class properties from the ground up."

Yieldstreet,"Yieldstreet is a management platform that provides institutional investors with access to income-generating investment products. Founded in 2015, Yieldstreet gives individuals access to alternative investments that have traditionally been off-limits to the average investor. With over $2.5 billion invested across multiple asset classes, Yieldstreet is changing the way people generate passive income by lowering and removing the barriers that historically kept these lucrative opportunities far out of reach.  In 2013, founders Milind Mehere and Michael Weisz were frustrated that many investment strategies were typically reserved only for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. Typically, the average investor was left to choose between the stock market and bonds with falling yields - with few options in between. Asset-based investments had longer hold periods and a higher barrier of entry, keeping them well out of reach of accredited investors — even more so for unaccredited investors. As a result, they decided to leverage the growing fintech disruption to give more people access to these previously restricted alternative investments.  Milind’s background in building companies, combined with Michael’s decade-plus experience within investing and fund management, formed the core of Yieldstreet. Passion for their investors and employees, as well as a willing embrace of innovation, has been part of Yieldstreet’s identity from the beginning. Each decision to leverage a new technology, investment strategy, or originate a new deal is made with the goal of putting investors first.  That drive has propelled Yieldstreet across all 50 states, crossing $100M invested in less than eight quarters, with the $1B milestone coming only three years later. In 2019, Yieldstreet’s membership had grown to 100,000, and a savings account for members was launched.  Yieldstreet, since its launch in 2015, has not deviated from its goal to change investing for the better, nor has it slowed down. Yieldstreet was ranked as number 46 on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies and has been recognized by Built In as one of the Best Places to Work. Yieldstreet today delivers wealth generation options and alternative investments for more than 330,000 investors and has returned more than $1.3 billion in principal/interest.  Many alternative investment platforms only focus on one asset class, such as real estate or art. Yieldstreet’s offerings, accessed through cash or a low-fee IRA, cover a wide range of asset classes — art, real estate, legal, corporates, consumer, and commercial, via single investments or funds. Yieldstreet also offers its members short-term notes on offerings with a hold period between 3 and 6 months, which generally boast higher interest rates than money markets and CDs.  Yieldstreet is headquartered in New York and has offices in Brazil, Greece, and Malta. Michael Weisz serves as President and Milind Mehere serves as CEO. Together, they manage a team of more than 140 employees, all working toward Yieldstreet’s one goal: change the way people invest for the better."

Belong,"Belong is a residential network that vertically integrates all aspects of the home rental and home improvement process. There is more than one American Dream. Owning your home is one of those dreams. It's been an aspiration for a long time, and we know that millions struggle to achieve it. But there are other American Dreams. Some of these dreams are about living differently than previous generations - for whom owning was everything. We may want to use our cash to start a business. We may want to experience new places. We may not have the money yet for home ownership, but still dream of living in a glorious home where we can put down roots and experience the sense of belonging. This is a new mindset. We are a community of people looking for a dream rental, and people who own properties and are looking for people who will love them. The old-school terms ""landlord""​ and ""tenant""​ don’t apply in our world. Here, there are people who want to adopt homes for a while, and people who have wonderful residences ready for them. Our owners are not giant holding companies that own thousands of homes and view them as pure financial assets. There's a level of mutual respect and caring in our world that simply doesn't exist in the transactional, brutalist world of landlords and tenants. We manage properties for our owners, and treat the people who live there with the attention, speed and concern they deserve. And we support those who are living an ownership-free lifestyle by creating a true community everywhere we are. Our residents are connected not only to each other, but also to the local merchants, events, and institutions that give communities their unique character. Before, renters often felt like second-class citizens; with us, they are an immediate and integral part of the community. So, whether you own property and you're looking for someone to live in it and love it, or you're looking for a home where you can put down roots – for however long you're planning to be there – we are the answer. Renting is the new American lifestyle. We didn’t create it, but we're making it sing."

Otta,"Our mission is to become the world's career champion. This means putting candidates first — not companies. Today we're focused on building the better way to find a fulfilling job in tech. In the future, we'll help people find jobs at all of the best companies. Looking for a job is a frustrating experience. It's incredibly hard to find a good match. Job adverts lack useful information like salary and diversity data. Companies sometimes never respond. There’s a lack of friendly-support in those tough moments of rejection … the list goes on. When starting Otta, we saw that candidates are often treated as second-class citizens. So we set out to build a candidate-first job search: one that is laser-focused on providing the best experience for candidates. There’s a big market to go after in recruitment, with LinkedIn selling over $10bn/year of recruitment products. But it’s impossible to battle a giant like LinkedIn if you try and compete on all jobs from Day 1. So we chose tech companies as our first move. As we grow, we’ll expand into other industries to help more people find fulfillment. Since launching in Jan 2020, we’ve grown from 1,000 applications sent per month to multiple thousands sent every day, across the UK & US. Otta is becoming a must-have for companies, and this puts us in a strong position to demand a better experience for candidates. For example, what if we said to companies that jobs without a salary range will be shown last?"

Yieldstreet,"Yieldstreet is a management platform that provides institutional investors with access to income-generating investment products. Founded in 2015, Yieldstreet gives individuals access to alternative investments that have traditionally been off-limits to the average investor. With over $2.5 billion invested across multiple asset classes, Yieldstreet is changing the way people generate passive income by lowering and removing the barriers that historically kept these lucrative opportunities far out of reach.  In 2013, founders Milind Mehere and Michael Weisz were frustrated that many investment strategies were typically reserved only for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. Typically, the average investor was left to choose between the stock market and bonds with falling yields - with few options in between. Asset-based investments had longer hold periods and a higher barrier of entry, keeping them well out of reach of accredited investors — even more so for unaccredited investors. As a result, they decided to leverage the growing fintech disruption to give more people access to these previously restricted alternative investments.  Milind’s background in building companies, combined with Michael’s decade-plus experience within investing and fund management, formed the core of Yieldstreet. Passion for their investors and employees, as well as a willing embrace of innovation, has been part of Yieldstreet’s identity from the beginning. Each decision to leverage a new technology, investment strategy, or originate a new deal is made with the goal of putting investors first.  That drive has propelled Yieldstreet across all 50 states, crossing $100M invested in less than eight quarters, with the $1B milestone coming only three years later. In 2019, Yieldstreet’s membership had grown to 100,000, and a savings account for members was launched.  Yieldstreet, since its launch in 2015, has not deviated from its goal to change investing for the better, nor has it slowed down. Yieldstreet was ranked as number 46 on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies and has been recognized by Built In as one of the Best Places to Work. Yieldstreet today delivers wealth generation options and alternative investments for more than 330,000 investors and has returned more than $1.3 billion in principal/interest.  Many alternative investment platforms only focus on one asset class, such as real estate or art. Yieldstreet’s offerings, accessed through cash or a low-fee IRA, cover a wide range of asset classes — art, real estate, legal, corporates, consumer, and commercial, via single investments or funds. Yieldstreet also offers its members short-term notes on offerings with a hold period between 3 and 6 months, which generally boast higher interest rates than money markets and CDs.  Yieldstreet is headquartered in New York and has offices in Brazil, Greece, and Malta. Michael Weisz serves as President and Milind Mehere serves as CEO. Together, they manage a team of more than 140 employees, all working toward Yieldstreet’s one goal: change the way people invest for the better."

Cellares,"Cellares develops the Cell Shuttle, to overcome the challenges associated with manufacturing so these life-saving therapies are affordable and widely available to patients who can benefit. The clinical impact of cell therapy in treating cancer has been proven, but this therapeutic approach has several limitations, especially in manufacturing, leaving extremely sick patients waiting for treatment and desperate for hope. Since cell therapy is currently produced for a single patient at a time, it is expensive to manufacture, requiring significant time and resources, and is difficult to scale.  Preclinical and clinical scientists, as well as commercial cell therapy manufacturers also lack the options to fully automate their manufacturing process quickly, safely, cost-effectively, and at the scale they need. The Cell Shuttle is an automated and closed end-to-end manufacturing solution that is flexible and scalable, enabling customers to run exact processes specified for their cell therapy. Compared with the current manual manufacturing processes for cell therapy, the Cell Shuttle’s next-generation automated manufacturing solution has 10 times the scalability (meaning 10 times more patient doses can be produced simultaneously), enables a three-fold reduction in process failure rates, and will reduce the per-patient manufacturing cost by up to 70 percent for most processes."

Untether AI,"Untether AI is creating a new class of specialized processor targeting an extreme point on the energy-complexity scale. By eliminating as much complexity as possible while still being able to perform the operations necessary to do neural net inference and putting that processing as close as possible to the memory, we can get close to theoretical minimum power numbers for the given process (initially targeting 28nm). Neural net inference will become increasingly important on all types of devices. These devices operate with strict energy budgets which in some cases are too restrictive for any current inference technology and in other cases limit overall intelligence due to the maximum inference throughput. Untether AI is uniquely positioned to solve this problem with architecture that maximizes inference output for minimum power and is completely scalable."
